## Introduction

The concept of using voice-activated technology to control a wheelchair aims to provide a unique and innovative solution that sets itself apart from conventional projects. By integrating this cutting-edge technology with a mechanical system, we aim to simplify the lives of individuals with disabilities and generate interest in our ever-advancing society.

## Problem Statement

Many people with disabilities lack the dexterity required to operate a switch on an electric wheelchair. This becomes a significant challenge for quadriplegics who have no control over their arms or legs. Our project seeks to address this issue by enabling wheelchair control through voice commands.

## Objectives

The primary objective of this study is to implement an efficient application utilizing a small vocabulary word recognition system. Our methodology involves the integration of a microprocessor with a speech recognition development kit for isolated word recognition from a dependent speaker. The resulting design will be employed to control a wheelchair and home appliances, enhancing the quality of life for handicapped individuals through vocal commands.

## How it Works

- The user issues voice commands to the system.
- The system employs a word recognition algorithm to interpret the commands.
- Based on the recognized command, the wheelchair's motion or home appliances are controlled accordingly.

## Conclusion

Our voice-activated wheelchair control system offers a promising solution to improve the mobility and independence of individuals with severe motor disabilities. By harnessing the power of voice commands, we aim to enhance the daily lives of those who rely on wheelchairs for their mobility.
